# NiceGUI App with Plugin System

This is a NiceGUI-based application with a plugin system, user management, and configuration storage using SQLAlchemy.

## Features

- User management with default admin creation
- Plugin system with enable/disable functionality
- Configuration storage in SQLite database
- Advanced logging
- Display current time

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:
pip install nicegui sqlalchemy
pip install RPi.GPIO adafruit-circuitpython-charlcd waveshare-epd Adafruit_DHT pysnmp paho-mqtt

Copy
2. Run the application:
python app.py
Copy
3. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`

## Plugins

Plugins are stored in the `plugins` directory. Each plugin should be a Python file with a `Plugin` class that inherits from `PluginBase`. The `tick` method of each plugin is called every second if the plugin is enabled.

To create a new plugin, add a new Python file to the `plugins` directory with the following structure:

```python
from app import PluginBase

class Plugin(PluginBase):
 def __init__(self, app):
     super().__init__(app)
     # Initialize your plugin here

 async def tick(self):
     # This method is called every second
     pass
Configuration
The application uses SQLite for storing configuration and user data. The database file is app.db in the root directory.
Logging
Logging is set up to output to the console with INFO level. You can adjust the logging level and format in the app.py file.
Future Improvements

Implement user authentication and authorization
Add more plugins (GPIO dimable LED, Raspberry LCD display, E-paper, GPIO thermometer, SNMP, MQTT)
Create a web interface for managing plugins and configuration

Copy
This setup provides a basic structure for your NiceGUI app with a plugin system, database configuration, and time display. To implement the specific plugins you mentioned (GPIO dimable LED, Raspberry LCD display, E-paper, GPIO thermometer, SNMP, and MQTT), you would need to create separate plugin files for each in the `plugins` directory, following the structure of the sample plugin.

For example, here's a skeleton for the GPIO dimable LED plugin:

```python
# plugins/gpio_dimable_led.py
from app import PluginBase
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Plugin(PluginBase):
    def __init__(self, app):
        super().__init__(app)
        logger.info("GPIO Dimable LED plugin initialized")
        # Initialize GPIO here

    async def tick(self):
        # Implement LED dimming logic here
        pass

    def set_brightness(self, value):
        # Implement brightness setting logic
        pass
